Description:

This program is about reading graph's edge from file and display to screen.
Then it apply the dps and scc algorithm.

TestFile and tests:

This program use Makefile phony targets to run the test.

test1.in is the simple form provided from class locker.
It will test the basic file (graph/edge) reading, and the printing for basic case.
Since not all vertices have a edge, this file could test the case that the vertex has no edge(null case).

test.in is a standard graph with cycle.
It can test for the common situations.

target testBase:
	This is the most basic target using test1.in to test the basic behavior of the program.
	The output should be like the sample provided in ho10.txt description.

target testLVBase:
	This target uses test1.in, the simple file to test.
	It should test out if handling the graph by IntList or IntVec has differences.
	Two output should be the same.

target testLUBase:
	This target tests the case that the IntList handling a simple undirected graph.(test1.in)

target testUBase:
	This could test if the program could handle the undirected graph for test1.in(simple case)
	The output should be like:
	vertex  start   finish
	1       1       8
	2       9       10
	3       2       3
	4       4       7
	5       5       6
	6       11      12

target test:
	This tests the performance for the common directed graph, test.in

target testU:
	This could test if the program could handle the common undirected graph for test.in

target testLU:
	This tests the case that IntList handling the undirected graph.

target testLVU:
	This target test for the graph in standard condition, if the output between IntList and IntVec are the same, using
	test.in
