## Algorithm

```
mostUndominated(L: list of pizza) {
    if (size of L <= 2) {
        ls <- new empty list.
        if (size of input is 1) {
            add the pizza in L to the ls.
            return ls.
        }
        a <- first pizza in L.
        b <- second pizza in L.
        if (a dominate b) {
            add a to ls.
        } else if (b dominate a) {
            add b to ls.
        } else {
            higher <- the pizza with higher cost in a, b.
            lower <- the pizza with lower cost in a, b.
            add higher to ls.
            add lower to ls. 
        }
        return ls.
    }
    left <- mostUndominated(first half of L).
    right <- mostUndominated(second half of L).
    return merge(left, right).
}

addToList(r: a list of pizza, cur: current pizza) {
    if (r is empty) {
        add cur to r.
    } else if (the cost of last pizza in the r >= cur's cost) {
        add cur to r.
    }
}

merge(first: a list of pizza, sec: another list of pizza) {
    if (first is empty) return first.
    if (sec is empty) return sec.
    
    ls <- new empty list.
    i <- 0.
    j <- 0.
    while (i < first's size or j < sec's size) {
        if (i == first's size) {
            j <- j + 1.
            addToList(ls, sec[j]).
            continue.
        }
        if (j == sec's size) {
            i <- i + 1.
            addToList(ls, first[i]).
            continue.
        }
        a <- first[i].
        b <- sec[j].
        if (a's popularity > b's popularity) {
            addToList(ls, a).
            i <- i + 1.
            if (a's cost < b's cost) j <- j + 1.
        } else if (a's popularity == b's popularity) {
            if (b's cost > a's cost) {
                addToList(ls, b).
                j <- j + 1.
            } else {
                addToList(ls, a).
                i <- i + 1.
            }
        } else {
            addToList(ls, b).
            j <- j + 1.
            if (a's cost > b's cost)
                i <- i + 1.
        }
    }
    return ls.

## Proof for Correctness

**Base case**:

This algorithm works on the base case that the input list's size is less than 2. It can direct determine which pizzas are needed. If each of them cannot dominate other, the only case is that for $(p_0, c_0)$ and $(p_1, c_1)$, ($p_0 > p_1$ and $c_0 > c_1$) or ($p_1 > p_0$ and $c_1 > c_0$). The pizzas are sorted in descending order on both popular and cost.


**Inductive Hypothesis**:

Suppose that the algorithm most is true for all lists of length < n. For any list L of length < n, mostUndominated(L) correctly find the undominated pizzas L'.

**Inductive Step**:

For the list with size n. The algorithm divides the list into two smaller one with size n / 2, and solves into `Left` and `Right`. Since the `Left` and `Right` containing the undominated pizzas of two sub-list are sorted in descending order with popular and cost, we can iterate from front to back for each list once. If one pizza is not dominated by other one and also not dominated by the last one in the output list, we can add it into output list and keep the output list sorted. 

**Concusion:**

Therefore, the algorithm can produce correct undominated list of pizzas for all the n >= 0.

## Time Complexity

**Base case**: the input with size less than 2, there is a constant time comparasion.

**Dividing**: we keep dividing the input list into 2.

**Merge case**: we merge the output of two recursive dividing. The input of merge is the output of last merge. The merge does not guarantee reducing the number of output. So, the worest case is for input list with size `x` producing output list with size also `x`. Though, since the input of merge must sort by popular and cost, we only takes `x` comparasion to build output list.

So we can write our recursion function: 

```
    T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n
```

By applying Master Theorem, we can see our algorithm have runtime `O(nlog(n))`

## Space Complexity

Since the algorithm needs create a list at most length `n` for level, the space requires `O(n)`.
