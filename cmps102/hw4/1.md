# Part A

## Algorithm

```
maxPalindrome(s) {
        if (s is empty) {
            return 0;
        }
        history = new two dimensional array with s.length() + 1, and s.length() + 1 as the dimentsions;
        for (i from 0 to s.length - 1) {
            history[i][i] = 0;
            history[i + 1][i] = 1;
        }
        for (i from 0 to s.length - 1) {
            next = ith character in s;
            end = i + 1;
            for (j from i - 1 to 0) {
                start = j;
                prev = jth character in s;
                if (next equal to prev) {
                    if (next beside to prev) {
                        history[end][start] = 2;
                    } else {
                        history[end][start] = 2 + history[end - 1][start + 1];
                    }
                } else {
                    history[end][start] = Max(history[end][start + 1], history[end - 1][start]);
                }
            }
        }
        return history[s.length()][0];
    }
```

## Time Complexity

The algorithm has several loops. The first loop runs `n` times, which is the length of the input string. Each operation inside takes a constant time, just assigning the value. 

The second loop also runs `n` times. Though, the third loop runs inside of second loop. The operation inside third loop is constant. This operation, according to the nested loop, will run for $\sum_{i = 0}^ni \in O(n^2)$

## Space Complexity

The algorithm only takes an extra 2d array with size n * n. Therefore, the space complexity is $O(n^2)$.

## Proof for Correctness

**Base case:**

When the length of the input string is 0, the algorithm will directly return 0. No palindrome is possible. When the length of the input string is 1, the algorithm will first initialize the history array, filling the content with the single string. Then, it will directly return the single string. 

**Inductive Hypothesis:**

The algorithm will produce correct result for all the input strings, where the length of them are less than `N`.

**Inductive Step:**

Suppose we have the input string with length `N`. The algorithm will first solve the `N - 1` substring correctly and cache the result of them into the array. Adding the `N`th character has two situations. 

If the new char equal to the head character of substring from 0 to `N - 1`, it forms a new longer palindrome subsequence based on the longest palindrome subsequence in the substring of range from 1 to `N - 1`. The algorithm will record the new palindrome as the solution for `N`.

If the new char is not equal to head character, the longest palindrome subsequence must be the same with the solution of the substring with the length `N - 1`. The algorithm will just ship the larger old result as the result of `N`.

**Conclusion:**

We can conclude that this algorithm will work for all the input string with length greater or equal to 0.

# Part B

Modify the algorithm is simple, just use 2d array to record the longest palindrome subsequence instead of the length of longest palindrome subsequence.

```
maxPalindrome(s) {
        if (s is empty) {
            return "";
        }
        history = new two dimensional array with s.length() + 1, and s.length() + 1 as the dimentsions;
        for (i from 0 to s.length - 1) {
            history[i][i] = emptry string;
            history[i + 1][i] = ith character in s;
        }
        for (i from 0 to s.length - 1) {
            next = ith character in s;
            end = i + 1;
            for (j from i - 1 to 0) {
                start = j;
                prev = jth character in s;
                if (next equal to prev) {
                    if (next beside to prev) {
                        history[end][start] = prev concat next;
                    } else {
                        history[end][start] = prev concat history[end - 1][start + 1] concat next;
                    }
                } else {
                    history[end][start] = the string with greater length between history[end][start + 1] and history[end - 1][start]);
                }
            }
        }
        return history[s.length()][0];
    }
```
