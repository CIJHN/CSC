(a) Logarithms $\log_2 f(n)  = O(log_2 g(n))$,

It's false. The counterexample is $f(n) = 2 \times \sqrt[n] 2$ and $g(n)=\sqrt[n] 2$. $f(n) \in O(g(n))$, but $log_2 ({2 \times \sqrt[n] 2}) = 1 + \frac 1 n$ and $log_2{2^{\frac 1 n}} = \frac 1 n$. But, $\lim\limits_{n \to \infty}{\frac {1 + \frac 1 n}{\frac 1 n} = n = \infty}$.

(b) Exponentials $2^{f(n)} = O(2^{g(n)})$.

It false. The counterexample is $f(n) = 5n$. $f(n) \in O(n)$. $2^{f(n)} \notin O(2^{n})$, since $0 \le 2^{5n} \le c2^{n}$ doesn't hold: $2^{5 * 2} > 2 \times 2^2$

(c) Polynomials $f(n)^d = O(g(n)^d)$, for any constant d ≥ 1.

According to the condition $f(n) = O(g(n))$, we can see that $0 \le f(n) \le cg(n)$ where $c \in$ ℝ. And since $f(n)$ and $cg(n)$ are all greater than zero. A power $d \ge 0$ applying to both of them doesn't break the relation. Therefore, $0 \le f(n)^2 \le (cg(n))^2$ and $0 \le f(n)^2 \le cg(n)^2$.
