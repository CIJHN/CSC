(a) 
Yes.

Algorithm:
    
    create a new table t to store data
    for each man m
        t[m] = a sorted list for m that store the woman with preferred order, and all the indifferent woman are stored adjacently in random order.
        
    return the result of GS output with table t

The time complexity is $O(n^2)$. The GS algorithm has $O(n^2)$. And the sort step with the sorted indifference input only take $O(n)$ and for n men, it takes $O(n^2)$. 

(If the input is unordered the sort might take $nlog(n)$, and for each man sorted list will take $n^2log(n)$. Then the complexity will be $n^2log(n)$)

The space complexity is $O(n^2)$ to store the table.

This algorithm will terminated since the only loop run n times for each man. And, the GS will terminate so this algorithm will terminate finnally. 

Proof:

GS promises that it will find the set $S$ that pairs in it are all stable. Since the meaning of unstable pair in the input with indifference case is the same with the commom case, the GS can still hold it's effect and performance. Therefore this algorithm is work in this case.


(b)

No.

Consider the pairs $(m_0, w_0)$ and $(m_1, w_1)$. Suppose $m_0$ and $m_1$ both prefer $w_1$ and $w_2$ indifferently. Then, $(m_0, w_1)$ and $(m_1, w_0)$ are also valid stable pair. Though, it has the weak instablity.
