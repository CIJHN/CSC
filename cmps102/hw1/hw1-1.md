1. (a) Run the GS algorithm for both man-appealing and woman-applealing. 
If their result matchings are the same matching, then there is exactly one stable matching for this instance, else there are multiple stable matchings.

Proof: 
    If their result matchings are the same matching, then there is exactly one stable matching for this instance.

    Man-appealing will output the pairs that are the very first stable matcing pair for that man. Woman-applealing will output the pairs that are the very first stable matcing pair for that woman.

    So for every pair (m, w), m is the first stable one for w, and w is the first stable one for m.

    Then, in every stable matching S for this instance, the pair (m, w) belongs to S:
        Proof by contradiction:
        Assume there is a stable matching S', where (m, w') and (m', w) exist. It means m prefer w' more than w, and w prefer m' more than m. Though, it's impossible, since the m is the first stable one for w, and w is the first stable one for m.

    Since every (m, w) belong to every matching S, there must be only one identical matching S for this instance. (Since they are all the same!)

Proof: (else case)
    If their result matchings are NOT the same matching, there are multiple stable matchings.

    The two different outputs of man-prefer and woman-prefer algorithm are already the evidence of existence of multiple stable matching
