    <h2>Points Attempted</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Assignment 6: 1r. The user can click on an object to select it. Selected objects are highlighted. If the background is clicked,
            all objects are unselected.
        </li>
        <li>
            Assignment 6: 2r. If the user holds down the left click and drags across the screen, the currently selected object is translated
            accordingly within the xy-plane.
        </li>
        <li>
            Assignment 6: If the user scrolls with the scroll wheel, the currently selected object is scaled accordingly. If you don't
            have easy access to a scroll wheel, it's Ok if you bind the scaling transformation to a different set of controls.
        </li>
        <li>
            Assignment 6: If the user holds down the right click and drags across the screen, the currently selected object is rotated
            accordingly.
        </li>
        <li>
            Assignment 6: Lighting should match translations
        </li>
        <li>
            Assignment 6: If the user holds down the middle mouse button (scroll wheel) and moves the mouse up and down, the currently
            selected object is translated accordingly along the z-axis.
        </li>
        <li>
            Assignment 6: Correctly handle multiple objects. That is, transforming one object has no effect on the other objects in the
            scene.
        </li>
