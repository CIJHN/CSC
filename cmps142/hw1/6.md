# 1

## a

6 unique values. They are 0, 1, 2, 3, and 5.

## b

6 unique values. They are 0, 1, 2, 3, and 5.

## C

The values of $Sex$, $Embarked$ and $Title$ are all kind of enums. They are discrete, finited and determined values. Therefore, the weka could use nominal value to represent each of them by constructing 1 to 1 mapping.

# 2

## a

The accuracy is 81.0526%.

## b

| a   | b   |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 106 | 14  | a=0 |
| 22  | 48  | b=1 |

## c

The number of leaves is 15, and the size of tree is 19.

# 3

## a

The accuracy is 82.6316%.

## b

The number of leaves is 326, and the size of tree is 335.

## c

The unpruned will keep the tree large, more tree node (more width), and greater height. Even the accuracy raises a little bit, it may cause a overfiting to the model.
