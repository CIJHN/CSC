# 1

(a) 5 unique values. They are 0, 1, 2, 3, and 5.

(b) 7 unique values. They are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

(c) The values of $Sex$, $Embarked$ and $Title$ are all kind of enums. They are discrete, finited and determined values. Therefore, the weka could use nominal value to represent each of them by constructing 1 to 1 mapping.

# 2

(a) 78.602 %

(b)

| a   | b   |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 364 | 65  | a=0 |
| 85  | 187  | b=1 |

(c) The number of leaves is 2, and the size of tree is 3.

# 3

(a) 80.7418 %

(b) The number of leaves is 1103, and the size of tree is 1117.

(c) The unpruned will keep the tree large, more tree node (more width), and greater height. Even the accuracy raises a little bit, it may cause a overfiting to the model.

(a)

@import "1.png" 

The big trend of the graph shows that test accuracy is increasing. I believe the prune function will reduce the tree's size without changing to much on the tree performance. Though, it still can decrease some accuracy as the accuracy floats from about 78% to 85%.

(b)

@import "2.png" 

The C will control the size of tree since it `controls the degree to which the tree is pruned`. When the C becomes greater greater, the tree will not be pruned so much. Therefore, it will keep more nodes in it.
