let $E$ be the event that older child is boy.

Our sample space is that (in case that `{older, younger}`) `{Boy, Boy}`, `{Boy Girl}`, `{Girl Girl}`, `{Girl Boy}`, 4 possiablity. Due to the probabilities of having a boy or a girl are both $\frac 1 2$, each case have $\frac 1 4$ chance to occure.

From that, we known $ P(E) = \frac 1 2$ for sum of two case `{Boy, Boy}`, `{Boy Girl}`.

let $B$ be the event that both children are boy.

We want to known the probability that the couple has two boys, which is $P(B|E)$

From formular we know

$$ 
P(B|E) = \frac {P(B, E)} {P(E)}
$$

From our sample space, we can see that $P(B) = \frac 1 4$. At the same time, if $B$ occure, $E$ must occure. (In the case that both children are boys, the older child must be a boy)

Therefore, $P(B, E) = P(B)$ and 
$$
P(B|E) = \frac {P(B, E)} {P(E)} = \frac {P(B)} {P(E)} = \frac 1 2
$$

The case is similar to above. Our sample space is `{Boy, Boy}`, `{Boy Girl}`, `{Girl Girl}`, `{Girl Boy}`, and the probability of each is $\frac 1 4$.

Let $E$ be the even that there is at least on child is boy.

From our sample space, we can see that there are 3 cases matched: `{Boy, Boy}`, `{Boy Girl}`, `{Girl Boy}`. 
Therefore, the $P(E) = \frac 3 4$

Let $B$ be the event that both children are boy.

From our sample space, we can see that $P(B) = \frac 1 4$. At the same time, if two children are boys, there must be at least one boy. Therefore $P(B, E) = P(B)$

Then,

$$
P(B|E) = \frac {P(B, E)} {P(E)} = \frac {P(B)} {P(E)} = \frac 1 3
$$
