Lisp and Scheme are standard `functional programming language` (of course). They are based on `λ-calculus`

### Evaluation in strong typed language:

1. Every expression has exactly one type.

2. When an expression is evaluated, exactly one of the following general things might happen :

    - it may evaluate to a value of the same type as the expression,
    - it may raise an exception,
    - it may not terminate,
    - it may exit.

### Beta Reduction

The procedure that evaluate (reduce) the expression with value:

    (lambda a -> a + b * a) (5)
reduce to

    (5 + b * 5)

### Go To Statement Considered Harmful

It was published on Com- munications of the ACM, Vol. 11, No. 3, March 1968 by **Edsger Dijkstra**.

~~I think this idea is really well-known...~~

### Polymorphism

Universal polymorphism are **parametric polymorphism** and **inclusion(subtyping) polymorphism**.

Parametric polymorphism is basically the java generic and c++ template. 

The inclusion polymorphism is the hierarchy structure in java and c++ 

These polymorphsm brings us:

- Parametric: the ablity to define the class for certain types that adapts with same operations/functions/methods set.
- Inclusion: the ability to define the different classes and use them with a same interfaces.

Parametric(java):

    List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
    list.add("a");
    List<Integer> intList = new ArrayList<>();
    intList.add(1);
    // here the same method shared with the different generic-type

Inclusion(java):

    class Worker {
        public void work() { /*do some work*/ }
    }

    class Programmer extends Worker {
        @Override
        public void work() { /* do coding stuff */ }
    }

    class Manager extends Worker {
        @Override
        public void work() { /* do managing stuff */ }
    }

    List<Worker> allWorkersInCompany = new ArrayList<>();
    allWorkersInCompany.add(new Manager());
    allWorkersInCompany.add(new Programmer());
    allWorkersInCompany.add(new Programmer());
    for (Worker w : allWorkersInCompany) {
        w.work(); // all workers, whatever programmer or manager, are called work with same interface
    }

Two other polymorphsm:

- Coercion: implicit type conversion between several types
- Overloading: a single identifier denotes several functions/methods

Coercion (java): 

    1 + "1" // int + string -> string
    1 + 0.1f // int + float -> float

Overloading(c++):

    class Matrix2X2 {
        // overload the + operator
    }

    auto a = Matrix2X2(2, 2, 3, 3);
    auto b = Matrix2X2(1, 1, 3, 3);
    auto c = a + b; // c == Matrix2X2(3, 3, 6, 6);
    auto d = 1 + 1; // d == 2
    // here + operator perform two function with different type

## Common functional operations and implementations

### reduce (fold_left)

Scheme:
```(scheme)
(define (reduce func init ls) 
    (if (null? ls) init
        (reduce func (func init (car ls)) (cdr ls))
    )
)
```

OCaml:
```(ocaml)
let rec reduce func init ls = 
    match (ls) with 
    | [] -> init
    | car::cdr -> 
        reduce func (func init car) cdr
```

### reduceRight (fold_right)

Scheme:
```(scheme)
(define (fold_right func ls init)
    (if (null? ls) init
        (func init (fold_right func (cdr ls) (car ls)) )
    ) 
)
```

OCaml:
```(ocaml)
let rec reduceRight func ls init = 
    match (ls) with 
    | [] -> init
    | car::cdr -> 
         func init (reduceRight func cdr car)
```

### reverse

Scheme:

```(scheme)
(define (reverse ls)
    (define (reversee ls accum)
        (if (null? ls)
            accum
            (reversee (cdr ls) (cons (car ls) accum) )
        )
    )
    (reversee ls `())
)
```

OCaml:

```(ocaml)
let reverse ls = 
    let rec reversee ls accum = 
    match (ls) with 
    | [] -> accum
    | car::cdr ->
        reversee cdr (car :: accum)
    in reversee ls []
```

### map

Scheme:

```(scheme)
(define (map func list)
    (define (mapp func list accum)
        (if (null? list) 
            accum
            (mapp func (cdr list) (cons (func (car list)) accum) )
        )
    )
    (reverse (mapp func list `()))
)
```

```(scheme)
(define (map func list)
    (reverse (foldl 
        (lambda (val ls) (cons (func val) ls)) 
        `() 
        list)
    )
)
```

```(scheme)
(define (map func list)
    (if (null? list) 
        `()
        (cons (func (car list)) (map func (cdr list)) )
    )
)
```

OCaml:

```(ocaml)
let map func ls = 
    let rec mapp func ls accum = 
        match (ls) with
        | [] -> accum
        | car::cdr ->
            mapp func cdr ((func car) :: accum)
    in List.rev (mapp func ls [])
```

```(ocaml)
let map func ls = 
    List.rev (List.fold_left 
        (fun prev v -> ((func v) :: prev)) [] ls)
```

```(ocaml)
let rec map func ls = 
    match (ls) with
    | [] -> []
    | car::cdr ->
        (func car) :: (map func cdr)
```

### filter

Scheme:

```(scheme)
(define (filter pred ls)
    (reverse (foldl 
        (lambda (val accum) (if (pred val) (cons val accum) accum) ) 
        `()
        ls
    ))
)
```

```(scheme)
(define (filter pred ls)
    (if (null? ls) 
        `()
        (if (pred (car ls)) 
            (cons (car ls) (filter pred (cdr ls)) )
            (filter pred (cdr ls) )
        )
    )
)
```

OCaml:

```(ocaml)
let filter pred ls = 
    List.rev (List.fold_left (fun accum v -> if (pred v) then (v :: accum) else accum) [] ls) 
```

```(ocaml)
let rec filter pred ls = 
    match (ls) with
    | [] -> []
    | car::cdr ->
        if (pred car) then (car :: (filter pred cdr)) else (filter pred cdr)
```
